# Simple Akinator API
This is a simple Akinator API that allows you to play the Akinator game and guess characters using Express. After running the server, a database will be created. You need to manually enter your data into the question, character, and answer tables in the database. The answer should be in the form of a boolean: true (1) or false (0).
